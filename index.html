                    <h2>Istanbul, TURKEY</h2>
                    <p> I have lived most of my life in this beatiful city. It was never easy to get around thanks to heavy traffic but I still loved the place that I was born and raised. With a population little over 15 million Istanbul is one of the most
                        densly populated metropolitan areas of the world.Due to its strategic position connecting continental Asia and Europe many civilizations had fought over the control of this ancient city. It is quite normal to see artifacts dating
                        back to the east Roman Empire.</p>

                    <h2>Houston, Texas</h2>
                    <p> After briefly working as a teacher in Istanbul, I decided to look for a job overseas. My first choice was not Houston. But as luck would have it, I ended up finding a teaching job in Houston, a city known for its hot weather and high
                        humidity. Of course, I did not know neither of those things before moving to Houston. Even if I did, I would never imagine how hot it could get in July where you would be risking potential heat stroke even under the shade.

                    <h2>Lubbock, Texas</h2>
                    <p> I have never spent more than a month in a small town. So, Lubbock was a strange experience for me. It only took a year for Houston's hot weather to wear me down. Then, I decided to move out of town to a different place. Lubbock was
                        not really on the top of my list. But that is where my employer had an openning at. What is interesting about this city is that you can drive 6 hours to any direction east, west, north or south, and still not see a big city. It
                        was truly a place in the middle of nowhere. Summers were hot and dry. Winters were cold and little snowy. In fact, Lubbock is the most northern city in the state of Texas, only Texan town where you can build a snow man every year.</a>

                    <h2>El Paso, Texas</h2>
                    <p> Where do you go after such an extreme place like Lubbock? Well, again my employer had an opening at another strange place called El Paso. This bordertown had a very warm welcoming atmosphere thanks to its residents. It is the most
                        eastern city of the state of Texas. Desert ecosystem was interesting. You can drive for hours and not bump into a tree. Rain is a rare occasion. When it rains it literally pours, so every resident runs the risk of getting caught
                        in flash flooding. There is a giant military base in the middle of the city, Fort Bliss. Imagine seeing tanks and personnel carriers sprinting in the desert while driving to work. It feels almost like a scene out of a movie. You
                        drive on a highway by the border and can get a close peek into the city of Juarez, one of the most violent cities in Mexico. These two cities used to be one back in the day. However, the fate drove them apart to a point where El
                        Paso is ranked the safest city in the USA while its brother, Juarez suffers the disastrous consequences of drug violence in the hands of Mexican Cartels.
